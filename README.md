# All around Discord botðŸ¤–

This is a bot made for our personal needs on our discord server, but if you are interested in you can use this as a bot logic for your own<br>
Unfortunately **we can't provide you our own bot, but here is a short guide how you can make your own bot for this purpose!**

## Setup your own bot ðŸ”§
## 1. Create a bot
First, [click here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to get to the **Discord Developer Portal**<br>
In here, you need to click the applications button on the left hand corner<br>

If you are on the application page, you need to create a new application, to do this, click the button on the right hand corner<br>

Add a name to it and get inside your application<br>
When you are inside, you are going to see a settings menu on the left hand side, click the Bot menu button<br>

Here, create your own bot, give it a name and make the following settings (not every one of them is necessary, but some of them is nice to have)<br>

If you are DONE, copy the discord **Bot token code** on this page (later you need this), your token code is the long letter-number combination near the top. If you not see it by default, Click the `Reset Token` Button<br>

## 2. Invite your bot to your server
In the next step, you need to get your client id, and paste it in the following link:<br>

>discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=`|Your client ID|`&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands<br>

To get your client ID, you need to click the OAuth2 button on the left menu and look for the client ID on the middle, like the following:

Paste your client code to the previous URL and copy it to a new browser page. After a while, you get a similar look<br>
Here, choose the server you want the bot to connect to and click the `Authorize` button on the bottom

If everything was right, you get the following comfirmation page:<br>
