# All around Discord botðŸ¤–

This is a bot made for our personal needs on our discord server, but if you are interested in you can use this as a bot logic for your own<br>
Unfortunately **we can't provide you our own bot, but here is a short guide how you can make your own bot for this purpose!**

## Setup your own bot ðŸ”§
### Create a bot
First, [click here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to get to the **Discord Developer Portal**<br>
In here, you need to click the applications button on the left hand corner<br>

If you are on the application page, you need to create a new application, to do this, click the button on the right hand corner

Add a name to it and get inside your application<br>
When you are inside, you are going to see a settings menu on the left hand side, click the Bot menu button<br>

Here, create your own bot, give it a name and make the following settings (not every one of them is necessary, but some of them is nice to have)<br>

If you are DONE, copy the discord **Bot token code** on this page (later you need this), your token code is the long letter-number combination near the top. If you not see it by default, Click the `Reset Token` Button<br>
